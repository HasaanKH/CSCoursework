Slice is a 2D top-down arcade game, where players fight against
ever increasingly difficult waves of bots. The game automatically creates new procedurally generated maps, in order to keep the game exciting and players on their toes.
Here are a few images of the game:

Technologies used:

This game was developed using Unity game engine using C#. An Object oriented paradigm was used to instantiate bots and maps alike. Perlin noise algorithm was used to procedurally generate maps. And Pathfinding was done through the A* algorithm.

How to play this game:

Download the repo, and import into Unity hub, then build the game for whichever OS you are using.
